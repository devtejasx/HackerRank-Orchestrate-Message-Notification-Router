# HackerRank Orchestrate

Starter repository for the **HackerRank Orchestrate** 24-hour hackathon.

## Message Notification Router

Build an AI-powered system for WhatsApp that decides which messages deserve immediate attention, which should wait, and which should be muted.

The system must reason over multimodal messages, including text messages, image posters/screenshots, and voice notes.

WhatsApp is noisy. A user can receive family chats, society notices, school updates, co-worker messages, business account promotions, image posters, voice notes, and scams in the same message stream. Treating every message the same creates two bad outcomes: important messages get missed, and unwanted or risky messages interrupt the user.

Read [`problem_statement.md`](./problem_statement.md) for the full task spec, input/output schema, allowed values, and submission format.

## Solution progress

| Phase | Status | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — data layer** | Complete | [`DATA_LAYER.md`](./DATA_LAYER.md) |
| **2 — features + classification** | Complete | [`PHASE_2.md`](./PHASE_2.md) |
| **3 — personalisation signals** | Complete | [`PHASE_3.md`](./PHASE_3.md) |
| **4 — routing engine** | Complete | [`PHASE_4.md`](./PHASE_4.md) |
| 5 — output generation | Not started | — |

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py                     # all phases on a representative sample
python main.py --message msg_091   # the full decision process for one message
python main.py --all               # every message, with distribution summaries
python -m pytest                   # 576 tests
```

The system now produces a complete routing decision for every message:

| Measure | Result |
|---|---|
| **Action accuracy** vs the 30 labelled rows | **96.7%** (29/30) |
| `message_type` accuracy | 96.7% (29/30) |
| Labelled scams delivered | **0** |
| Confidence, correct vs incorrect decisions | 0.82 vs 0.60 |

Phase 2 classifies into one of eleven `message_type` values. Phase 3 turns that
into ten independent, explained routing signals personalised to the recipient —
nine of which order monotonically `notify > digest > mute` without ever seeing
an action label. Phase 4 combines them into the final decision with a reason,
a confidence and supporting historical evidence.

The one remaining miss is a voice note whose type needs speech recognition;
routing is correct on every message the classifier got right.

`output.csv` is intentionally still blank. `RoutingResult.to_output_row()`
already emits exactly the six required columns, so Phase 5 has only to write
them.

## What You Need to Build

For every row in `dataset/messages.csv`, produce one row in `output.csv` with:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `message_id` | Incoming message ID |
| `action` | One of `notify`, `digest`, or `mute` |
| `message_type` | Best-fit message category |
| `reason` | Short human-readable explanation |
| `confidence` | Number from `0` to `1` |
| `evidence_message_ids` | Historical message IDs used as evidence; write `none` if there is no useful evidence |

Your system should make personalized decisions using the provided message, user, group, business, media, and historical interaction data.
For image and voice-note messages, `images.csv` and `voice_notes.csv` only provide file paths; your system should inspect the media files themselves.

---

## Suggested Workflow

1. Inspect `dataset/sample_messages.csv` to understand the expected output format.
2. Load `dataset/messages.csv` and all relevant context files.
3. Build your routing system using any approach: LLMs, retrieval, rules, classifiers, agents, or hybrids.
4. Write predictions to `output.csv`.
5. Evaluate your approach on the solved sample rows before submitting.

You may use any language or runtime. Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript are all reasonable choices.

---

## Requirements

Your solution must:

- be runnable from the terminal
- read the provided files from `dataset/`
- produce a valid `output.csv`
- include one prediction for every `message_id` in `dataset/messages.csv`
- not use organizer-only files or hardcoded labels

If you use API keys or secrets, read them from environment variables. Never hardcode secrets in the repo.

---

## Evaluation

Your `output.csv` will be compared against hidden ground-truth labels.

The scoring will consider:

- correctness of `action`
- correctness of `message_type`
- usefulness and consistency of `reason`
- whether `evidence_message_ids` point to relevant historical messages
- reasonable confidence calibration

Strong systems will combine retrieval, structured metadata, behavioral history, safety checks, OCR/ASR handling, and contextual reasoning.

## Chat Transcript Logging

This repo includes an [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) file for AI coding tools. It asks compatible tools to append conversation summaries to:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| macOS / Linux | `$HOME/hackerrank_orchestrate_august26/log.txt` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\hackerrank_orchestrate_august26\log.txt` |

Upload this log as your chat transcript at submission time. Do not paste secrets into the chat.

---

## Submission

Submit the following files as instructed by HackerRank:

1. **Code zip**: full runnable solution, prompts/configs, README, and any evaluation files.
2. **Predictions CSV**: final `output.csv` for all rows in `dataset/messages.csv`.
3. **Chat transcript**: the `log.txt` described above.

Before submitting, confirm:

- `output.csv` has one row per row in `dataset/messages.csv`.
- `output.csv` has the exact required columns in the exact required order.
- Your runnable code and setup instructions are included in `code.zip`.
